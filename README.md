# blsucapstone

The project is a web application for the BCA BLSU, facilitating connections, resource sharing, 

and support for Black and Latine students while encouraging prospective BIPOC students. 

We will build the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, (Maybe:Express.js), SQL, Auth0, (Mayber:Socket.io), Google Calendar, and Heroku.
